Sooqha Docs aims to be "blazing fast," making performance a core competitive advantage. A robust performance benchmarking strategy is crucial to
   ensure this promise is met and maintained.

  Key Performance Goals

  Based on the product_overview.md, the explicit performance targets are:

   * Load time: < 2s
   * AI response time: < 3s
   * Export speed: < 5s
   * Uptime: 99.9% (though this is more infrastructure-related, client-side performance contributes to perceived uptime)

  Beyond these explicit goals, the general performance goals are:

   * Editor Responsiveness: Smooth typing, scrolling, and interaction even with large documents.
   * UI Fluidity: No jank or stuttering during UI transitions or AI panel interactions.
   * Memory Usage: Efficient memory consumption to prevent browser slowdowns or crashes, especially for long sessions.

  Benchmarks to Test Against

  Sooqha Docs positions itself against established players. Benchmarking against them will provide a realistic competitive context.

   * Direct Competitors:
       * Obsidian: For local-first, markdown-first performance. Sooqha aims to match or exceed its speed in these areas.
       * Notion: For general document editing performance, especially with rich content.
   * Indirect Competitors:
       * Google Docs: To highlight Sooqha's "blazing fast" advantage over legacy, cloud-heavy tools.

  What to Measure and How

  Performance measurement will involve a combination of automated tools, synthetic tests, and real user monitoring (though RUM might be
  post-MVP).

   * Load Time:
       * What: First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Time to Interactive (TTI), Total Blocking Time (TBT).
       * How:
           * Lighthouse: Automated audits run in CI/CD for every commit/PR.
           * WebPageTest: For more detailed waterfall analysis and network condition simulation.
           * Playwright E2E tests: Measure page load times within a controlled environment.
   * AI Response Time:
       * What: Time from AI command trigger (e.g., /summarize) to AI output appearing in the side panel. This includes network latency to OpenAI
         and client-side processing.
       * How:
           * Custom Logging: Implement precise performance.now() measurements around the OpenAI API call and response handling in src/lib/ai.ts.
             Log these times to the browser console during development and potentially to an analytics service (post-MVP).
           * Playwright E2E tests: Measure the duration of AI interactions within automated test scenarios.
   * Export Speed:
       * What: Time from clicking an export button to the file download prompt appearing or the PDF preview rendering.
       * How:
           * Custom Logging: Measure the duration of the export functions in src/lib/export.ts.
           * Playwright E2E tests: Automate export scenarios and measure the time taken.
   * Editor Responsiveness/UI Fluidity:
       * What: Frames per second (FPS) during typing, scrolling, and complex editor operations (e.g., applying styles to large selections).
       * How:
           * Chrome DevTools Performance Tab: Manual profiling during development to identify jank and long tasks.
           * Playwright E2E tests: Use Playwright's tracing capabilities to capture performance profiles during specific interactions.
   * Memory Usage:
       * What: Heap size, DOM node count.
       * How:
           * Chrome DevTools Memory Tab: Manual profiling to detect memory leaks, especially after long sessions or repeated AI calls.
           * Playwright E2E tests: Capture memory snapshots at key points in user flows.

  Specific Scenarios or Flows to Benchmark

   * Application Startup:
       * Cold load of /editor/:docId route.
       * Warm load (after initial visit).
   * Document Loading:
       * Opening an empty document.
       * Opening a small document (e.g., 500 words).
       * Opening a large document (e.g., 5,000+ words, near localStorage limits).
   * Core Editor Interactions:
       * Rapid typing of 100 words.
       * Scrolling through a 5,000-word document.
       * Applying markdown formatting (bold, italic, heading) to a large selection.
   * AI Integration Flows:
       * Triggering /summarize on a short paragraph.
       * Triggering /summarize on a long document.
       * Triggering /rewrite on a sentence.
       * Triggering /fix-grammar on a paragraph with errors.
       * Repeated AI calls within a short period to test rate limiting and responsiveness.
   * Export Flows:
       * Exporting a small document to Markdown, HTML, PDF.
       * Exporting a large document to Markdown, HTML, PDF.

  How to Track Regressions Over Time

   * CI/CD Integration: Integrate Lighthouse and Playwright performance tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
       * Thresholds: Set strict performance budgets and fail builds if metrics fall below defined thresholds (e.g., LCP > 2s).
       * Trend Reporting: Configure CI/CD to generate and store performance reports (e.g., JSON output from Lighthouse, Playwright traces).
   * Dedicated Performance Dashboard:
       * Use a tool (e.g., Grafana, custom dashboard) to visualize performance metrics over time.
       * Plot trends for load time, AI response time, and export speed.
       * Overlay deployment markers to correlate performance changes with specific code releases.
   * Automated Alerts:
       * Set up alerts (e.g., via CI/CD or monitoring tools) if key performance metrics degrade significantly (e.g., AI response time increases by
          10% over baseline).
   * Regular Benchmarking Runs:
       * Schedule weekly or daily automated performance tests against a stable staging environment.
       * Compare results against the established benchmarks (Notion, Google Docs, Obsidian) periodically to ensure competitive advantage is
         maintained.
   * Performance Budget:
       * Define and maintain a clear performance budget (as outlined in the performance-benchmarker.md context) for JavaScript bundle size, CSS,
         images, and API calls. Monitor these budgets in the CI/CD pipeline.

  By implementing this comprehensive strategy, Sooqha Docs can proactively identify and address performance bottlenecks, ensuring it remains a
  "blazing fast" and intelligent writing experience.
